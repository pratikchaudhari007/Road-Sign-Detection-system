# Road Sign Detection

This repository contains code for Sign recognition using openCV and python. If you want to test the code then run road.py file

# Technology used :
-openCV (Opensource Computer Vision)
-Python
-scipy

# Labraries requirement
opencv-python
numpy
scipy


# How it works :

The images are pre-processed with several image processing techniques, such as threshold techniques, Gaussian filter, Canny edge detection, Contour and Fit Ellipse. Then, the Neural Networks stages are performed to recognize the traffic sign patterns and inform driver what's the sign board is actually trying to say.
